With the miniaturization of integrated circuits, highly dense electronic components inevitably generate substantial Joule heat during high-speed operation, leading to demanding requirements for efficient heat dissipation. Therefore, effective thermal management plays a pivotal role in further developing the semiconductor industry and provides a solid impetus better to understand phonon heat conduction mechanisms at the micro-nano scale.

During the academic study and work at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Hong Kong, Dr. Wang has been extensively engaged in the development and utilization of first-principles and machine-learning computational methods to microscopically elucidate phonon scattering and transport mechanisms, particularly in fields closely related to high-order anharmonic phonon behaviors, such as thermal transport, lattice dynamics, and structural phase transitions.
