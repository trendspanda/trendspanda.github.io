An Assistant Professor in Institute for Advanced Study. Before joining SZU, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). Dr. Wang obtained his B.E. degree from China University of Petroleum-Beijing (CUPB) in 2015 and his M.S. degree from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2017, both in Chemical Engineering. He obtained his Ph.D. degree (2021) in Mechanical Engineering from HKU under the supervision of Prof. Yue Chen. 

Dr. Wang's current research focuses on developing and implementing first-principles-based methods and machine-learning approaches to simulate the dynamics of phonons and electrons at the atomic level and their application to thermal management. Research topics include heat transport phenomena, anharmonic lattice dynamics, and structural phase transition for energy-converting materials, covering perovskites, thermoelectrics, and superionic conductors.
