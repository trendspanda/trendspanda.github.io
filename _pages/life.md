I have a deep love for animals, especially my Chihuahua, Coffee, who is now just over a year old. Coffee brings me endless joy and is truly my inseparable companion. We often head out on little adventures together, with Coffee snug in my backpack, exploring new places side by side. Coffee isn’t just my friend; he’s my “little healer.” Whenever life brings its worries, Coffee’s warmth and presence have a way of calming me and filling my heart with peace and happiness. He’ll always be my dear friend, and our journey together will keep going strong.

I’m also drawn to nature, and I especially enjoy the peaceful escape of picking fruit in the countryside, away from the city’s hustle and bustle. The act of picking fruit gives me a sense of accomplishment and a genuine connection to the land. I love sharing the fresh bounty with friends and colleagues—their smiles bring me so much joy. When I come across a sunrise or sunset, I always take a moment to pause and appreciate the beauty and serenity of the scene. These moments with nature rejuvenate me, offering a profound sense of calm and connection.

During holidays or my free time, I enjoy crafting or trying out new recipes to share with others. Recently, I made essential oil soap as gifts for my colleagues, and it was a big hit! Whether it’s handcrafting or cooking, I truly enjoy the creative process and the joy of sharing the results. Each new project brings me a sense of exploration and fulfillment. For me, these hobbies are more than just pastimes—they’re ways to enrich my life and connect with those around me.
